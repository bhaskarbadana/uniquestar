    <p style="color:black; text-align: center;font-size: larger;">This project aims to develop a user-friendly, centralized web platform that allows users to access various popular services such as online shopping, food delivery, movie streaming, anime content, and gaming from a single unified interface. Rather than switching between multiple websites or apps, users can conveniently launch their favorite platforms or search for content from one place.
